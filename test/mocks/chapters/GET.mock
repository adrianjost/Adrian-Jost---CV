As time went by I was assigned more and more responsibilities and now I am one of the longest active developers in the project. Sadly, the development team changed a couple of times in the last 2 years, which resulted in some really bad code and architectures. For this reason I was allowed to invest more and more time in the documentation and onboarding of new developers and I am now one of the lead developers in the complete rewrite of the frontend.  My task is to integrate the learnings, from the first version, into the second version and prevent the failures we had done before. This means that I develop a new architecture for the project together with a small team,  I integrate workflow supporting tools (e.g. for documentation or git workflows) and develop concepts on how to optimize our code quality and test coverage.","to":"2020-03-31","img":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/curriculum-vitae-5cd0a.appspot.com/o/cloud-transparent.png?alt=media&token=9bb8676a-79ba-4027-af98-691e0c419b43","section":"work"}]}
